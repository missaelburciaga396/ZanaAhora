      hi everyone, I did 5x5 juice of carrots by Dr. Ludwig jhonson to healf my
      stomache ache, first let me tell you a story about me, every morning
      betwheen 6:00AM and 8:00AM currently I feel pain in the colon, so I should
      tell you one day I cannot go to the restroom to shit for 5 days Â¿WTF? So I
      think I founded the source of this problem, and I want to share it whit
      you
