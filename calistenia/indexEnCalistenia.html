      <h1 class="title">Calisthenics</h1>
      <p>
        Here I will talk to you about the basics of calisthenics. First of all,
        let me introduce you to the first 3 basic calisthenic exercises. For
        example, the pull-up is a pull exercise, while dips and push-ups are a
        push exercise, and lastly, squats are a leg exercise. <br />
        So, my friends, let me send you to a video that talks about
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYyLFByh-RQ">
          the types of muscle fibers.</a
        >
        And also another video that talks about mechanical tension that will be
        very useful for planning your training type.

        "So we will decide what type of training to do. You can do a smart
        routine mixed with volume and high intensity, but really I don't know
        how to do this for now, and right now I am focusing on explosiveness and
        strength. Therefore, I can't tell you much about volume training. In my
        case, they are high intensity exercises like explosive pull-ups,
        explosive dips, single-leg squats, etc. So, my friends, let me tell you
        what your "natural limit" is, in many quotes, since the body mass index
        is an approximate of a normal and healthy weight. When I started
        exercising, I weighed around 50 kilos, I couldn't do 3 push-ups in a
        row, 2 pull-ups at most, and since I have always run and played
        basketball, I already had some previous leg training. Therefore, below I
        leave you a calculator that indicates our BMI, body mass index, and the
        body mass index to calculate our "natural limit" to a certain extent."

        There are several ways to divide our workout routine, but there are
        three main ones. I'll leave you this video to introduce you to one of
        the three ways to divide our training throughout the week.

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        However you train, you have to do it frequently so that it becomes a
        habit. During the process of learning to exercise, you can continue to
        research and train at the same time. Don't get caught up in analysis
        paralysis. You will see that when you create the discipline of doing, at
        first, 20 minutes of daily exercise and resting 2 days a week, little by
        little you will be able to do more repetitions or have more strength.
